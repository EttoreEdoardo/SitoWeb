  <h1>Progress and info - 2022</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; font-style: italic; font-size: 25px">The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated global income inequality, partly reversing the decline of the previous two decades. Weak recoveries in emerging markets and developing economies are expected to raise between-country inequality. Globally, refugees were at the highest absolute number on record in 2021. The war in Ukraine is creating one of the largest refugee crises of modern times.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px;">Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, more than three-fifths of countries with available data saw higher growth in household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40% of the population than the national average. The pandemic is threatening to reverse this trend. In 2020 many countries saw declines in the growth of the bottom 40% of greater magnitude than the national average.<br><br>
    Banks’ profitability weakened in 2020 mostly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, although reported asset quality remained good. Based on financial soundness indicators data for 2015 -2020, the fraction of countries reporting return on assets (ROA) above 1.0% declined to 48% in 2020 from 72% in 2019, and the median ROA declined from 1.5% to 1.0%.<br><br>
    IOM’s Missing Migrants Project recorded 5,895 deaths on migratory routes worldwide in 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic figures and making it the deadliest year on record for migrants since 2017.<br><br>
    By mid-2021, the number of people who were forced to flee their countries due to war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and events seriously disturbing public order had grown to 24.5 million, the highest absolute number on record. For every 100,000 people, 311 are refugees outside their country of origin – this is an increase from 216 in 2015. In addition, as of 12 April 2022, around 4.7 million refugees from Ukraine crossed borders into neighbouring countries.<br><br>
    Globally, in 2021, 62.3% of 138 countries with data reported having a wide range of policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, defined as having policy measures for 80% or more of the 30 sub-categories under the six domains of the indicator.<br><br>
    The proportion of tariff lines applied to imports admitted duty free from LDCs, SIDs, and developing countries have remained relatively stable in recent years, at around 64.5%, 65% and 51%, respectively.<br><br>
    The global average cost of sending $200 decreased from 9.3% in 2011, to 7.42% in 2016 and 6.3% of the amount sent in 2021, getting closer to the international target of 5%.</p>
