  <h1>Progress and info - 2022</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; font-style: italic; font-size: 25px">The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated global income inequality, partly reversing the decline of the previous two decades. Weak recoveries in emerging markets and developing economies are expected to raise between-country inequality. Globally, refugees were at the highest absolute number on record in 2021. The war in Ukraine is creating one of the largest refugee crises of modern times.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px;">Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, more than three-fifths of countries with available data saw higher growth in household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40% of the population than the national average. The pandemic is threatening to reverse this trend. In 2020 many countries saw declines in the growth of the bottom 40% of greater magnitude than the national average.<br><br>
    Banks’ profitability weakened in 2020 mostly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, although reported asset quality remained good. Based on financial soundness indicators data for 2015 -2020, the fraction of countries reporting return on assets (ROA) above 1.0% declined to 48% in 2020 from 72% in 2019, and the median ROA declined from 1.5% to 1.0%.<br><br>
    IOM’s Missing Migrants Project recorded 5,895 deaths on migratory routes worldwide in 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic figures and making it the deadliest year on record for migrants since 2017.<br><br>
    By mid-2021, the number of people who were forced to flee their countries due to war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and events seriously disturbing public order had grown to 24.5 million, the highest absolute number on record. For every 100,000 people, 311 are refugees outside their country of origin – this is an increase from 216 in 2015. In addition, as of 12 April 2022, around 4.7 million refugees from Ukraine crossed borders into neighbouring countries.<br><br>
    Globally, in 2021, 62.3% of 138 countries with data reported having a wide range of policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, defined as having policy measures for 80% or more of the 30 sub-categories under the six domains of the indicator.<br><br>
    The proportion of tariff lines applied to imports admitted duty free from LDCs, SIDs, and developing countries have remained relatively stable in recent years, at around 64.5%, 65% and 51%, respectively.<br><br>
    The global average cost of sending $200 decreased from 9.3% in 2011, to 7.42% in 2016 and 6.3% of the amount sent in 2021, getting closer to the international target of 5%.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px;">Source: <a class="l-storia" href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/29858SG_SDG_Progress_Report_2022.pdf">Report of the Secretary-General, Progress towards Sustainable Development Goals-E/2022</a></p>
  <h1>Progress and info - 2021</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px;">Before the pandemic, modest gains had been made in the reduction of inequality in certain areas, for example, reducing income inequality in some countries and territories, continuing preferential trade status for lower-income countries and territories and decreasing transaction costs for remittances. However, inequality persists, whether in relation to income, wealth, opportunity or other dimensions. The pandemic is exacerbating existing inequalities within and among countries and territories and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest countries and territories hardest, and is likely to delay the progress of the poorest countries and territories on the Goals by a full 10 years. Globally, the number of refugees reached its highest level on record in 2020. Even with strict COVID-19-related restrictions on mobility around the world, thousands of migrants died on their migratory journey. <br><br>
    According to estimates of the International Monetary Fund, the COVID-19 pandemic would increase the average Gini index for emerging market and developing economies by more than 6 per cent, with an even larger impact predicted for lowincome countries and territories. <br><br> Data from 44 countries and territories for the period 2014–2020 show that almost one in five people reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one of the grounds prohibited under international human rights law. Moreover, women were more likely to be victims of discrimination than men. The health and socioeconomic situations of many groups already experiencing higher levels of discrimination have been further affected by the pandemic. <br><br>
    The data from 2019 on financial soundness indicators indicated some improvement of overall loan performance, while the levels of capital, which is the main buffer for absorbing losses, remained high despite a slight decline. The share of countries and territories reporting non-performing loans whose value exceeds 5 per cent of total loans declined from 41.9 per cent in 2018 to 39.5 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, the share of countries and territories reporting a ratio of total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets of more than 15 per cent declined from 84.6 per cent in 2018 to 82.1 per cent in 2019, although the median rose from 17.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent over the same period. <br><br>
    In 2020, 4,186 deaths and disappearances were recorded along migratory routes worldwide, with an increase in fatalities on some routes. Despite the pandemic and mobility restrictions at borders across the world, tens of thousands of people continued to leave their homes and embark on dangerous journeys across deserts and seas. <br><br> By mid-2020, the number of people who had fled their countries and territories and become refugees owing to war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order had grown to 24 million, the highest number on record. The number of refugees outside their country of origin has risen to 307 out of every 100,000 persons, more than double the figure at the end of 2010. <br><br>
    Globally, in 2019, 54 per cent of the 111 Governments with data reported having instituted a comprehensive set of policy measures to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, which means that they have reported having policy measures in place for at least 80 per cent of the subcategories that make up the six policy domains of this indicator. The degree to which the policy measures were reported, however, varies widely across policy domains, with most countries and territories reporting measures for cooperation and partnerships and for safe, orderly and regular migration, and fewest countries and territories reporting measures for migrant rights and for socioeconomic well-being. <br><br>
    From 2017 to 2020, the proportion of products exported by the least developed countries and developing countries that receive duty-free treatment has remained unchanged at 66 and 52 per cent, respectively. <br><br> In 2019, total resource flows for development to developing countries from Development Assistance Committee donors, multilateral agencies and other key providers amounted to $400 billion, of which $164 billion was ODA. <br><br>
    The average global cost of sending a $200 remittance decreased from 9.3 per cent in 2011 to 6.5 per cent in 2020, bringing it closer to the international target of 5 per cent. The average annual decrease was 0.31 percentage points.</p>

    <h1>Progress and info - 2020</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px;">Notwithstanding positive signs of reducing inequality in some dimensions, such as a reduction of relative income inequality in some countries and preferential trade status benefiting lower-income countries, inequality still persists in all forms. The COVID-19 crisis is hitting the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries the hardest and threatens to have a particularly damaging impact on the poorest countries. It is exposing the profound inequalities that exist within and among countries and is exacerbating those inequalities. <br><br>
      In 73 of the 90 countries with comparable data during the period 2012–2017, the bottom 40 per cent of the population saw its incomes grow. Moreover, in slightly more than half of those countries, the bottom 40 per cent experienced a growth rate in income that was higher than the overall national average. Still, in all countries with data, the bottom 40 per cent of the population received less than 25 per cent of the overall income or consumption, while the top 10 per cent received at least 20 per cent of the income. <br><br>
      Data from 31 countries over the period 2014–2019 show that one in five persons reported having personally experienced discrimination on at least one ground of discrimination prohibited by international human rights law. The pandemic risks exacerbating those patterns. <br><br>
      Of the 111 countries with available data as at September 2019, 54 per cent reported having a wide range of policy measures to facilitate the orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people. Central and Southern Asia (80 per cent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (79 per cent) reported having the highest share of countries with such policies, compared with only 33 per cent of the countries in Oceania and Northern Africa and Western Asia. <br><br>
      The proportion of products exported by least developed countries, developing regions and small island developing States that could enter international markets free of duty increased, from 66 to 67.4 per cent, 51.1 to 52.1 per cent and 65.4 to 66.5 per cent, respectively, from 2017 to 2018. <br><br>
      In 2018, total resource flows for development to developing countries from Development Assistance Committee donors, multilateral agencies and other key providers were $271 billion, of which $166 billion were ODA.</p>
